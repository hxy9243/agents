FireAttention V2 enhances long context LLM performance (8K-32K tokens) by addressing model quality and inference speed. Key improvements include Hopper support for FP16/FP8 prefill kernels and multi-host deployment for high traffic [https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference).

**Quality Benchmarks:** Tested with the RULER library, Qwen 72B was the only open-source model capable of handling long context tasks effectively [https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference).

**Performance Benchmarks:** Using Qwen2 72B (FP16) and Mixtral 8x7B (FP8), FireAttention V2 demonstrated significant improvements over vLLM [https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference):

*   **Short-Medium Generations:** Achieved approximately 1.7x higher throughput and 3.5x lower latency in FP16, and 5.6x higher throughput and 12.2x lower latency in FP8 (8 H100 GPUs).
*   **Long Generations:** Using multi-host mode (16 H100 GPUs), improved throughput by approximately 3.7x in FP16 and 8x in FP8, with latency improvements of 4x in FP16 and 11.3x in FP8 compared to vLLM.

#### FireAttention V3: AMD MI300 GPU Support

FireAttention V3 is optimized for AMD MI300 GPUs, achieving performance gains for LLaMA models. It showed 1.4x improvement for the average RPS @ 8 secs metric for LLaMA 8B model and 1.8x improvement for the average RPS @ 10 secs for LLaMA 70B model. In some low-latency scenarios RPS improvement can reach up to ~3x for NIM and up to ~5.5x for AMD vLLM [https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v3](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v3).

**Benchmarks:** Compared against NIM Containers on H100 and AMD vLLM on MI300 (FP8 precision) [https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v3](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v3):

*   **LLaMA 70B:** Showed significant improvements over NIM/AMD vLLM in throughput and latency, with up to 3x improvement over NIM and 5.5x RPS improvement over AMD vLLM in low-latency cases.
*   **LLaMA 8B:** Outperformed both NIM and AMD vLLM in low-latency mode.

#### FireAttention V4: FP4 on NVIDIA B200

FireAttention V4 achieves speeds of >250 tokens/second on NVIDIA B200 GPUs using FP4 precision, leveraging NVFP4 for Blackwell architecture [https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v4-fp4-b200](https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v4-fp4-b200).
