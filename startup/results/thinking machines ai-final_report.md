## Continuous Thought Machine (CTM)

Thinking Machines Lab is developing a new type of neural network called the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM). This model incorporates time into its thinking, mimicking how natural brains work [https://www.howtogeek.com/continuous-thought-machines-could-be-the-next-step-in-ai/](https://www.howtogeek.com/continuous-thought-machines-could-be-the-next-step-in-ai/). Sakana AI detailed the CTM model in a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05522) and a [blog post](https://sakana.ai/ctm/).

Key features include neurons with a short "memory" that can sync their firing patterns with other neurons. Challenges include longer training times, slower inference, lower accuracy compared to current transformer models, and the risk of "runaway" thinking [https://www.howtogeek.com/continuous-thought-machines-could-be-the-next-step-in-ai/](https://www.howtogeek.com/continuous-thought-machines-could-be-the-next-step-in-ai/).
