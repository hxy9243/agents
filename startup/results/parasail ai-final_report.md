# Parasail: The First AI Deployment Network

## Overview

Parasail is an AI Deployment Network and AI Compute Platform, founded by AI veterans Mike Henry and Tim Harris. The company was founded in late 2023, emerged from stealth in early 2024, and officially launched its platform on April 2, 2025. Parasail's mission is to build a fair and equitable compute economy to power the AI revolution, enabling builders and innovators to deliver the best AI products through easy access to scalable, cost-effective, and secure compute.

Parasail aims to provide AI companies with fast, scalable, and cost-efficient access to compute and cutting-edge AI models, addressing the limitations of traditional cloud providers that often fail to deliver true on-demand compute and lock customers into long-term contracts. The company is headquartered in San Mateo, CA, with some sources also citing San Francisco, CA.

## Leadership Team

Parasail is led by seasoned AI builders:

*   **Mike Henry:** Co-Founder and CEO. Henry has a career dedicated to building AI infrastructure and high-performance computing solutions. He previously founded Mythic, an early AI hardware company that raised $165 million, and served as Interim Chief Product Officer at Groq, where he helped launch a successful LLM cloud service.
*   **Tim Harris:** Co-Founder and Board Member. Harris is also the founder and CEO of Swift Navigation, a key player in early autonomous vehicles, where he built teams and products that generated hundreds of millions in sales and raised $250 million in venture capital.

The Parasail team includes former employees from NVIDIA, Google, and other industry players. The company is actively hiring individuals passionate about impacting the AI landscape.

## Products & Services

Parasail offers an AI compute platform designed to accelerate AI product development by providing a smarter, faster, and more cost-effective way to run AI. Its core offering is the **AI Deployment Network**, a cloud-hosted platform providing immediate, cost-efficient, and on-demand access to powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

### Key Offerings:

*   **On-Demand GPU Compute:** Parasail aggregates the largest truly on-demand GPU compute supply, including top-tier hardware like Nvidia H100s, H200s, A100s, and 4090s. The company claims its GPU fleet is larger than Oracle's, allowing companies to scale from zero to enterprise workloads rapidly without long-term contracts.
*   **AI Workload Optimization:** Parasail's proprietary orchestration engine automatically matches workloads across its global GPU network to ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency, simplifying complex workload management. A permutation engine selects the best hardware for specific workloads.
*   **Plug-and-Play Inference Solutions:** Parasail's inference solution supports production at scale through:
    *   **Serverless Endpoints:** Provides immediate access to the latest open-source models, including DeepSeek R1, LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, and Gemma 3, with optimized "Turbo Models" for faster application response times. Workloads run only when necessary, significantly minimizing idle costs.
    *   **Dedicated Instances:** Enables scaling private endpoints to millions of tokens per second in as little as 10 minutes, offering competitive on-demand GPU prices.
    *   **Batch Processing:** Designed for compute-heavy workloads and large-scale inference jobs, it significantly reduces costs with discounts on Serverless usage and cached prompt tokens.

### Value Proposition:

Parasail aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cloud providers by offering:

*   **Cost Efficiency:** Companies migrating from OpenAI or Anthropic can reduce costs by 15-30x. Parasail also offers an additional 2-5x cost advantage over other open-source providers by optimizing hardware matching and reducing idle compute costs. GPU prices range from $0.65 to $3.25 per hour, with Dedicated Instances available from $0.65 an hour.
*   **Rapid Deployment & Scalability:** The network enables companies to deploy production-ready endpoints to dozens of GPUs within hours, accelerating complex AI workflows and enabling inference in minutes. Users can go from prototype to production in hours, with instant scaling from a single GPU to production-ready clusters, eliminating DevOps bottlenecks.
*   **Flexibility:** Parasail operates a self-service platform with a "no contracts, no sales people, no surprises" policy, and users can begin with free credits.

## Funding

In 2024, Parasail secured **$10 million in Seed Funding**.

## Investors

Parasail's seed round investors include:

*   Basis Set Ventures
*   Threshold Ventures
*   Buckley Ventures
*   Black Opal Ventures

## Customers

Parasail has enabled more efficient deployments for several companies, including:

*   **Elicit:** Scaled scientific paper screening with real-time processing, removing bottlenecks related to high-quality real-time processing costs. Andreas Stuhlmüller, CEO of Elicit, stated that Parasail was essential in enabling them to screen over 100,000 scientific papers daily with minimal engineering overhead.
*   **Rasa:** Improved real-time model deployment in Europe, facilitating quick and cost-effective custom model deployment and enhancing user experience with lower latency endpoints. Alan Nichol, Co-Founder and CTO of Rasa, highlighted Parasail's speed and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Everpilot:** Slashed inference costs by 10X. Ted Benson, Founder and CEO of Everpilot, praised Parasail's inference pricing as the lowest he had seen, making it effortless to run open-source models.
*   **Weights & Biases:** Quickly gained access to massive DeepSeek capacity and top-shelf throughput. Shawn Lewis, CTO of Weights & Biases, commented on Parasail's rapid setup, stating they provide the latest and greatest faster than anyone else.
*   **Oumi:** Streamlined dataset generation through efficient batch processing, saving significant time and effort for dataset building and research. Oussama Elachqar, Co-Founder of Oumi, found Parasail's batch processing significantly easier for generating millions of responses.
*   **SambaNova** (mentioned as a customer).
