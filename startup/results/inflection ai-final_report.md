# Inflection AI Report

## Overview

Inflection AI, based in Palo Alto, CA, was founded in early 2022 by Mustafa Suleyman, Karén Simonyan, and Reid Hoffman. The company's initial mission was to make personal AIs available to everyone, with their primary product being Pi, a 'personal AI' designed to provide knowledge based on individual interests ([Inflection AI](https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding), [Inflection AI Blog](https://inflection.ai/blog/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding)). In March 2024, Microsoft acquired most of its workforce ([https://spectrum.ieee.org/inflection](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inflection)). According to a letter from CEO Sean White, Inflection AI is now focused on enterprise-grade applications of conversational intelligence ([https://inflection.ai/](https://inflection.ai/)).

## Funding

Inflection AI has raised a total of **$1.525 billion** over 4 rounds ([CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/inflection-ai/financials)).
