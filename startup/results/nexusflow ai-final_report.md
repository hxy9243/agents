## Products and Technology

Nexusflow offers a suite of GenAI solutions, including models that outperform GPT-4 in specific applications. Key products include:

*   **Nexusflow Solution:** Enables high-performance GenAI agents, powered by compact models for ownership and control. It allows domain specialization, continuous knowledge incorporation, and real-time responses at scale ([https://nexusflow.ai/](https://nexusflow.ai/)).
*   **Athene-V2:** Advances beyond scaling limits with targeted post-training, originating from UC Berkeley AI Research Lab ([https://nexusflow.ai/](https://nexusflow.ai/)). This includes:
    *   **Athene-V2-Chat-72B:** Matches GPT-4o across benchmarks, excels in chat helpfulness (Arena-Hard), code completion (bigcode-bench-hard), mathematics (MATH), and long log extraction ([https://nexusflow.ai/blogs/athene-v2](https://nexusflow.ai/blogs/athene-v2)).
    *   **Athene-V2-Agent-72B:** Balances chat and agent capabilities, surpassing GPT-4o in Nexus-V2 function calling benchmarks ([https://nexusflow.ai/blogs/athene-v2](https://nexusflow.ai/blogs/athene-v2)).
*   **NexusRaven-V2:** A 13 billion-parameter open-source model excelling in function calling. It demonstrates up to 7% higher tool use success rate than GPT-4 on general software tool use benchmarks ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231205329018/en/Nexusflow-Unveils-Open-source-Generative-AI-That-Empowers-Copilots-to-Use-Tools-and-Outperforms-GPT-4](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231205329018/en/Nexusflow-Unveils-Open-source-Generative-AI-That-Empowers-Copilots-to-Use-Tools-and-Outperforms-GPT-4)). Key capabilities include generating single, nested, and parallel function calls, providing detailed explanations, and generalizing to unseen functions ([https://huggingface.co/Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B](https://huggingface.co/Nexusflow/NexusRaven-V2-13B)).
*   **NexusRaven-13B:** An open-source LLM for function calling, achieving a 95% success rate in using cybersecurity tools with their demonstration retrieval system, compared to 64% for GPT-4 function calling API ([https://nexusflow.ai/blogs/introducing-nexusraven-13b](https://nexusflow.ai/blogs/introducing-nexusraven-13b)).
*   **Starling:** Ranked #1 among 7B models based on human evaluation in the Chatbot Arena ([https://nexusflow.ai/?tpcc=NL_Marketing](https://nexusflow.ai/?tpcc=NL_Marketing)).

Nexusflow emphasizes complete ownership and control, empowering agent development with domain specialization, and delivering low-cost, real-time responses.
